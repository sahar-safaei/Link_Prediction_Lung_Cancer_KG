# Link_Prediction_Lung_Cancer_KG
This repository contains codes and datasets to reproduce results of the Master Thesis EVALUATING HYBRID AI FOR PREDICTION OVER LUNG CANCER KNOWLEDGE GRAPHS.

## AMIE
Implementations for conducting link prediction using rules generated by AMIE.
* Use repository (https://github.com/dig-team/amie to mine rules).
  ** Cloned October 2023.
* run java command "java -jar amie3.jar -const benchmark_train.tsv".
* Run "main.py --benchmark" to get right linke prediction result.
 
## ConvE
* Cloned October 2023.
* Implementations for ConvE.
* Original repository: (https://github.com/TimDettmers/ConvE).
* Test files in benchmark_Test_Rel_Type folder is used to evaluate different relation types.
* Use ConvE.ipynb to get right link prediction result.

## OpenKE
* Cloned October 2023.
* Implementations for TransE, TransH, TransR, TransD, RotatE, DistMult, and ComplEx.
* Original repository: (https://github.com/thunlp/OpenKE).
* Test.h, Tester.py is modified to get result for right link prediction.
* Test files in Test_Rel_Type folder for each benchmark is used to evaluate different relation types.
* Use OpenKE.ipynb to get right link prediction result.

## TuckER
* Cloned October 2023.
* Implementations for TuckER.
* Original repository: (https://github.com/ibalazevic/TuckER).
* Modified main.py to get result for right link prediction.
* Test files in Test_Rel_Type folder for each benchmark is used to evaluate different relation types.
* Use TuckER.ipynb to get right link prediction result.
